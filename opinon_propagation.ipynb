    "# A propaganda *Simulation* - Facts and False Balancing\n",
    "The following notebook simulates the effects of social networks on opinion propagation.\n",
    "Based on an interview of Jeff Bezos, the idea underlying the experiments in this notebook are the following: \n",
    "Humans are social animals. Social networks propagate opinions about something. Anyway there are opinions that are hard to prove and other opinions -- **facts** -- that are either true (*truth*) or false (*lie*). Even in the second case, **trust** in social networks can cause individuals in the network to believe in the *lie*. Anyway, as said by Jeff Bezos, in a healthy organization (e.g., a company, a state, or a society) usually **truth promoting mechanisms** are in place that give an advantage to the truth over the lie. These mechanism include discussions, scientific method, trustworthy fact-check entities (e.g., research departments), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, under some circumstances (e.g., when politicians -- i.e. very central nodes in a network -- spread lies), it might happen that the lie *wins* over the truth. In a very simplified simulation model, we study these effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a very **simplified scenario**. In this scenario there is someone who knows the truth and someone else who lies. Individuals in the social network look in their neighborhood (i.e., their first degree relationship). Based on their neighborhood, they change their *believe* about the truth value of the fact. Since there are mechanisms in place that favour the truth over the lie, the true opinion is weighted stronger than the lie. This weight is determined by a free parameter \\alpha. E.g., if alpha is 1.5 and 2 neighbors tell the truth while 3 are lieing it would be a tie (and then randomly the opinion will be determined). If alpha is 1.6 in the same scenario, the truth would win, if it's less than 1.5 the lie would win for this node. We then look at the distribution of truth and lie over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look into this distribution based on an initial opionon (or believe) of the social network, especially we try to simulate the impact of **false balancing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are several works on mathematical models and more formal methods to study opinon propagation in social networks. Here, we only study a simplified opinon propagation with simulation, without any rigorous formal proofs."

    "Some words on trust: Trust might be very dangerous in some cases while it is good in others. We all know people that argue like: ``An expert said this, so you have to believe it.'' This form of trust can be dangerous, because the expert could either lie intentionally, be no expert, or have made some mistakes. Therefore blind trust without any truth favouring mechanisms cause an organization to more likly start believing in a lie, especially when false balancing in favour of the lie is in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can clearly see from the simulations below is that a false balancing has a huge influence on the opinon propagation (even though in our model the opinon of influencer can be flipped in the same way everyones opinon can be flipped.). \n",
    "This even holds true if there are already truth promoting mechanisms in place that favor truth over lies. The false balancing effect (only in the initial opinon setup) kicks in really really hard. \n",
    "Roughly speaking, that means, if influencers are balanced, quickly the entire network will be balanced, even if influencers can be influenced like everyone else. \n",
    "\n",
    "Relating the results in our experiments to Noam Chomsky's propaganda model quickly shows, that also stable democracies are not necessarily fact seeking organizations. \n",
    "Having social network mechanisms for opinion propagation (and humans are social beings) one needs strong truth promoting mechanisms, to counter negative effects or false balancing effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that we do not want to state that every question can be answered by facts. Some questions use too vague language, or are too expensive to answer and a healthy gut feeling, experience, or historically similar questions/situations, have to be taken into account to built up an opinion about the topic. Unfortunatley also for facts, we can see that the opinion about these facts can be wrong or highly inbalanced. When talking about *lie*, we do not necessarily mean an intentional lie. It could also be a mistake (e.g., wrong results/measurements in experiments), random behaviour (e.g., an intelligence service that broadcasts false information for distraction)."
